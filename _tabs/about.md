I’m **Daniel Vieites** (**@vieitesss**), a developer focused on **DevOps**, **Linux tooling**, and **productive terminal-first workflows**. I’m currently working as a **DevOps Engineer**, where I blend scripting and automation with modern developer experience. I’m based in **Santiago de Compostela, Galicia (Spain)**. 

### What I write about

On this blog you’ll find practical, no-fluff articles on:

* **Neovim, dotfiles, and terminal productivity** (keymaps, plugins, shell and editor ergonomics).
* **DevOps and automation**: from everyday CLI scripts to lightweight tools that streamline builds, testing, and deployments.
* **Go, Bash, and other languages** for writing fast, reliable tools and scripts that improve developer workflows.

### Selected open-source projects

A few highlighted repos you’ll see referenced across posts:

* **nvim** - my Neovim configuration.
* **.mac_config** - my Mac's dotfiles, with configuration files for alacritty, tmux, karabiner, yabai, and many other tools.
* **command.nvim** — a Neovim plugin to run commands and track compilation errors right inside your editor. 
* **workspacesionizer.wezterm** — “tmux-sessionizer” vibes for **WezTerm**: jump between project directories and repos with minimal friction. 
* **2048-rs** — a terminal 2048 clone written in **Rust** using `crossterm`, because learning should be fun. 
* **ref** - a web scrapper built in Go with Bubbletea to get information from [quickref.me](https://quickref.me/)

### Background & interests

I enjoy turning rough, repetitive steps into **clean scripts and tools**—the kind you can drop into any workflow to save time every day. You’ll often see me exploring **Neovim/Lua**, **WezTerm**, **Bash**, **Rust**, and **Go**, and sharing pragmatic guides aimed at **real-world developer productivity**. On LinkedIn I regularly share notes on **DevOps, command-line automation, and Linux/macOS**.

### What you can expect here

* **Step-by-step tutorials** you can copy, paste, and tweak.
* **Opinionated deep dives** into editor/terminal setups.
* **Small, reusable code snippets** and plugin/config examples you can adopt immediately.

If you’re into **DevOps culture**, **terminal tooling**, and **developer experience**, you’ll feel at home.
